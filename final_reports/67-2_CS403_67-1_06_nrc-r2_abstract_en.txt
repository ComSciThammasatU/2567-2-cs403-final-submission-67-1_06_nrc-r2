ABSTRACT
    E-commerce platforms play a significant role in global business, and changing consumer behavior has driven the popularity of online shopping. The convenience of accessing products and services 24/7 enables consumers to make purchases instantly, unrestricted by time or location. However, purchasing decisions often rely heavily on customer reviews, significantly influencing new customers' choices.
	Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms have become a crucial source of information for businesses to identify issues and highlight the strengths of their products and services. Nonetheless, analyzing large volumes of reviews using traditional methods requires substantial resources. Therefore, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key solution to process and analyze review data efficiently, delivering insights quickly and accurately.
	This project aims to develop a web application for automatically analyzing customer sentiments from review texts. The system categorizes sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral using AI-based processing. This tool enables businesses to utilize these insights to improve their products and services effectively, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately boost sales in the long run.
